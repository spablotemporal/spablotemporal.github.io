One of my interests is in building bridges with different institutions that can promove future colaborations. I'm interested in exchanging ideas and knowledge with others. With contributions of different colaborators, I have created two workshops that I have been offering this last year and I'm interested in bringing this knowledge to other places.  

Other topics for workshops might be available upon request.  
**Workshops can be offered in English and Spanish**
