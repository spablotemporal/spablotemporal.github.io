One of my interests is in building bridges with different institutions that can promote future collaborations. I'm interested in exchanging ideas and knowledge with others. With contributions of different collaborators, I have created a couple of workshops that I have been offering since 2019. Some of these workshop has been offered multiple times in both Spanish and English, having a wide variety of participants including academics, government and industry from different countries. Workshops are available both remote and in person formats.  

Other topics for workshops might be available upon request.
