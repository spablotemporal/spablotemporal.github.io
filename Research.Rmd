## Research Interest

I find exciting the applications of spatio-temporal statistics and network theory to study the dynamic of diseases in populations and the impact of anthropogenic activities in human, animal and environmental health.

## Current projects.

As part of my work in my PhD i'm currently part of the Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance at UC Davis https://cadms.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/


### Foot and mouth disease modeling in Ecuador.  
Foot and mouth disease(FMD) is a viral disease that affects cloven hooved animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, among other domestic and wildlife ruminants. The importance of the disease is in the economic impact for affected countries. There has been great advances towards the eradication of the disease in South America in the last couple of years. Ecuador is in the last phase of eradication and the veterinary services is working hard on the eradication program. In this project in colaboration with AGROCALIDAD and PANAFTOSA, we apply tools from network theory and geostatistics to to develop tools that inform decision making.

## Other Side Quests.

### Consulting 
Since 2018, I also colaborate as consultant for the Veterinary Center for Clinical Trials of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of UC Davis. As part of my work there I assist on study design, sample size estimation and data analysis.  

### Following the COIVD-19 epidemic.  
During the las couple of weeks I've been following the COVID epidemic and using some simple tools to explore the progress of an outbreak using COVID19 in Mexico as an example.  
You can find my posts [Here](https://jpablo91.github.io/COVIDMx/).  
I am also developing web apps for other regions to estimate the hospital beds and ICU use, more information of this projects available upon request.

## Previous projects

### Classical Swine Fever in Peru.
Classical Swine Fever is a viral disease that affects the swine industry. In Peru, the disease is endemic and there is a current vaccination program. We applied methodologies from network theory and regression analysis to investigate the asociation of the incidence of the disaese with socio economic factors and the networ structure, and evaluate the vaccination program.
