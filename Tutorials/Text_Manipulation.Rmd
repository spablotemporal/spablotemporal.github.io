title: "Detecting strings"

We can use gsub to replace any string of numbers, characters or letters.

# Detecting numbers.

We use `"([0-9])"` to detect any number, for example:

```{r}
# Create a string of numbers from 1 to 10
x <- 1:10
# Replcae it
gsub(pattern = "([0-9])", replacement = ".", x = x)
```
